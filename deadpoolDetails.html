						<h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3> 
                        <p>
                            Welcome to the Deadpool character bio, nerds!
						I mean...True Believers! Brought to you by me, myself,
						and I: the fabulous Deadpool! I could have let some
						smelly pencil-pushing intern spell out my life story for
						you, but you deserve better. So, here it is, straight
						from the Merc with a Mouth's mouthâ€”every detail of my
						morally ambiguous, mentally unstable, innuendo-laden
						past. From my very first appearance in NEW MUTANTS #98,
						to my latest booty-kicking, comic relief-ing
						anti-heroics, to a third thing that I can't think of
						right now, this is the definitive history of Deadpool.
                        <p>Okay, intro's over. Let the solemn origin story fade in?</p>
                        </p>
						<h3>Section One (My Origin)</h3> 
						<p>                        
                        Call me Ishmael. Just kidding.
						Don't do that. Like any misunderstood hero, I probably
						had a difficult childhood that led to my career as a
						professional killer. That, or someone brainwashed me
						into murdering my parents. If I don't remember, does it
						really count? Or matter? Let's just say that I was an
						orphan, a wizard put me on my aunt and uncle's doorstep,
						they raised me in secret, and then I went to a special
						magic school where a bald man regularly tried to murder
						me with voodoo. Okay, that's not true...but I do have a
						scar on my forehead! Several, actually! Anyway,
						seriously, I joined the military at 17 years-old, but
						was discharged soon thereafter. So, naturally, I decided
						to become an assassin (which is, by the way, an
						incredibly fun word to write).
